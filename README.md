When people say “stack-based navigation” in Flutter (or mobile apps in general), they’re talking about the way pages (screens) are managed using a stack data structure → LIFO (Last In, First Out).

🔑 How it works

Think of it like a stack of plates:

Navigator.push() → puts (pushes) a new page on top.

Navigator.pop() → removes (pops) the top page, revealing the one under it.

The user only ever sees the top page.



📌 Example in Flutter
// Go from LoginPage → CreateAccountPage
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const CreateAccountPage()),
);

// Go back
Navigator.pop(context);


Start: [LoginPage]

Push CreateAccount → [LoginPage, CreateAccountPage] (top = CreateAccountPage)

Pop → back to [LoginPage]



✅ Benefits of stack-based navigation

Natural “back” behavior (Android back button / iOS swipe).

Easy to follow flows (e.g., Login → OTP → Home).

Keeps history → you can return to the previous screen.




❌ Downsides

If you push too many pages without managing the stack, memory can grow.

Not ideal for things like bottom navigation, where you want tabs side by side (there you usually swap pages instead of pushing).





👉 So, stack-based = you’re literally managing screens like a stack (push new ones, pop old ones).
